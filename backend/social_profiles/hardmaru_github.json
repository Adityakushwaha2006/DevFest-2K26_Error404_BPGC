    "career_trajectory": "Started with JavaScript in 2018, exploring various deep learning frameworks like PyTorch-NEAT, TensorFlow, and Chainer RL. In 2020, they began working on reinforcement learning projects using OpenAI Baselines and Gym. They also experimented with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In recent years, their focus has shifted to World Models and Evolution Strategies. They have also been involved in various research papers and open-source projects.",
