    "career_trajectory": "Started with Jupyter Notebook in 2019, explored various tools and languages including Python, Lua, Cuda, Shell, CSS, and others. Showed interest in deep learning and computer vision through projects like U-Net implementation in PyTorch for FLAIR abnormality segmentation in brain MRI and a tiny and basic chess engine for lua. Developed expertise in reinforcement learning toolkit for compiler optimizations and webRTC implementation for Python using asyncio. Recently worked on large model training with torchtitan and 3D scene visualization with pyrender.",
