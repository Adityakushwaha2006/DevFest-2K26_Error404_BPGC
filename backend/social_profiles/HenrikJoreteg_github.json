    "career_trajectory": "Started with JavaScript in 2020, focusing on building small utility libraries like idb-keyval, tiny-object-hash, and feather-app. In 2021, they explored IndexedDB and screen wake lock APIs. The following year, they delved into React and Redux, creating projects like redux-bundler-react and redux-bundler-example. They also developed tools for object sync, validation, and diffing with sinks. By 2025, their focus shifted to composing Redux stores out of smaller bundles of functionality.",
