    "career_trajectory": "Started with Rust in 2019, focusing on various libraries and projects such as tokio-serde-json, tower-web, and wg-async-foundations. In 2020, they worked on miri, an interpreter for Rust's mid-level intermediate representation. They also contributed to other Rust-related projects like rustls and turbowish-mocks. In recent years, their work has shifted towards more web-focused projects like tower-lambda and hello-axum, as well as tools like pidfile-rust and mini-redis. Currently, they are exploring new areas such as protobuf libraries with buffoon and code generation with codegen.",
