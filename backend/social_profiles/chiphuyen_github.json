    "career_trajectory": "Started with Python in 2016, working on various deep learning projects such as TensorFlow and fastText. Pivoted to more general machine learning topics like OpenSeq2Seq and Milano in 2018. Continued to explore different libraries and tools like AWD-LSTM-LM, transformer-xl, and lazynlp. Recently focused on feature stores with feathr and machine learning systems design. Also experimented with various programming languages including Jupyter Notebook.",
