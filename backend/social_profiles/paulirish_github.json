They have also maintained their own personal projects, such as Scriberr and soft-navigation-trace-viewer. Their technical evolution is marked by a growing interest in performance optimization, debugging tools, and generative AI. In 2025, they started exploring Rust systems programming, but it's unclear if this is still an active area of focus.",
