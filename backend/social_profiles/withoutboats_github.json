    "career_trajectory": "Started with Rust in 2018, focusing on systems programming and concurrency. In 2020, began exploring async programming with libraries like async-std and async-h1. Later that year, delved into parser generation with lalrpop and concurrent data structures with dashmap. The following years saw a continued interest in Rust's unique features, such as garbage collection with shifgrethor and exception handling without fehler. In 2023, started exploring generators with propane.",
