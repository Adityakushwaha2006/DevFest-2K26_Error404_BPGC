    "career_trajectory": "This developer has shown a wide range of technical interests and skills over the past year, starting with Go and Python projects in June 2025, followed by Rust and TypeScript projects in July 2025. They have also worked on various utility libraries, including self-replace, insta-cmd, and agent-stuff. In December 2025, they started working on pi-mono, a monorepo for pi packages, and have been actively contributing to open-source projects such as gh-issue-sync and minijinja. They have also been thinking about the use case of prompt generators and have added a pure slop demo to pi-mono.",
