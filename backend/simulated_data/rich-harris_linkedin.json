Focus on a specific tech stack (e.g., Node.js & React) or a problem domain (e.g., SaaS platforms, real-time analytics). This helps you stand out.\n2. **Master Communication:** Technical skills are just half the battle. Clear, proactive communication with clients is paramount. Regular updates, setting expectations, and active listening build trust.\n3. **Build a Portfolio & Testimonials:** Show, don't just tell. Showcase past projects, even personal ones, and actively seek testimonials from satisfied clients. This is your social proof.\n\nIt's a challenging but incredibly rewarding path!

Link: [Example Article Link]\n\nIt's a crucial reminder that technical debt isn't just about 'bad code' but often strategic decisions with future implications. What really resonated with me was the emphasis on communication – explaining the 'why' behind architectural decisions and the impact of shortcuts to non-technical stakeholders. As a freelancer, managing client expectations around this balance is key to long-term project success.
