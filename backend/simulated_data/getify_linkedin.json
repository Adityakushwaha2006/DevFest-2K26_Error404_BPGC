It really resonated with our approach at Getify Solutions, where we emphasize architectural foresight and sustainable practices from day one. The article highlights how technical debt isn't just about 'bad code,' but often a symptom of unclear requirements, rushed timelines, and a lack of investment in long-term health.\n\nThis reinforces my belief that human-centric software development isn't just about the end-user, but also about the developers who have to live with, maintain, and evolve the codebase for years to come. Investing in good architecture and clean code is an investment in your team's sanity and your product's longevity. \n\nWhat are your go-to strategies for keeping large frontend projects maintainable?",

That's where true innovation and robust, maintainable solutions are built. What are your thoughts on balancing foundational knowledge with keeping up with new trends?",
